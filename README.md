 # devConnect

 ## Inspiration
 Inspired by the mission of BlackWings Hackaton, we wanted to focus on the importance of fostering community and networking. Underrepresented and untraditional students may experience a difficult process of finding where they can find a community of support when trying to break into tech. 

 ## What it does: 
Students who haven't had the oppurtunity to work on projects that showcase outside of the classroom is challenging. We want to help connect students who want to start their own projects and inspire collaboration. We want to connect students from across levels of experience together and uplift each other. This broaden networks but most importantly support other users.

## How We built it:
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, and PHP 
- Designed user-friendly pages to guide the user to sign up for the platform, create a project that others who are interested can sign up, and setting up connections with other users. 

## Challenges we ran into:
- Introduced to new technology which took a bit of time to learn
- Working with teammates despite timezone differences

## Accomplishments 
- Succesfully learning how to implement PHP 
- Collaborating and communicating on the timing 
- Supporting each other

## What we Learned 
- Learned how to work under pressure 
- Understood how to implement a server 

## What's Next For devConnect
- Update the UI to make it more user friendly
- Share with some volunteers to get their feedback
